Introduction
*******************************
This documentation is intended for developers looking to develop Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) based client application. Some knowledge on SIP is definitely required, and of course some programming experience. Prior knowledge of PJSUA C API is not needed, although it will probably help.

PJSIP libraries provide multi-level APIs to do SIP calls, presence, and instant messaging, as well as handling media and NAT traversal. Knowledge of SIP protocol details (such as the grammar, transaction, dialog, and whatnot) are not required (but it will help a lot!), however you should know how SIP works in general and particularly how to configure SIP clients to, e.g. register to a SIP provider, specify SIP URI to make call to, and so on, to use the module.
